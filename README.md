Parameters that can be adjusted:  
`number_cities` number of cities to search trough (0-24)  
`number_of_swaps` number of swaps used to swap cities in the *Hill Climb*  
`number_of_generations` used for termination condition  
`population_size` the size of the population  
`number_of_parents` prosentage of parents put in the new population  
`number_of_children` prosentage of childes put in the new population  
`mutation_rate` mutation probability
