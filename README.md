# Solving the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP)
Algorithms that are tested are the *Exhaustive Search*, *Hill Climb* and *Genetic Algoritm*.

Parameters that can be adjusted inside the `main.py` file:  
`number_of_cities` number of cities to search trough (0-24)  
`number_of_swaps` number of swaps used to swap cities in the *Hill Climb*  
`number_of_generations` used for termination condition  
`population_size` the size of the population  
`number_of_parents` prosentage of parents put in the new population  
`number_of_children` prosentage of childes put in the new population  
`mutation_rate` mutation probability  

### Usage:  
Simply run `python3 main.py` in the terminal.  

### System:
* MacOS Mojave
* Python 3.6.4
